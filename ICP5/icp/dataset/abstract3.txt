The game of Cricket is one which is followed and loved by a large proportion of the population across the world. The liking goes to such an extent that people even end up having games of cricket on their computers. In this paper we discuss about the development of a cricket game, Cricket Strategy Game. This is a special game, different from others, as it is one focusing on the strategizing, managing, and captaining aspects of cricket. There are many games that simulate a real game of cricket, but a game that simulates the role of a captain, manager or director in the sport of cricket are rarely found. Hence we present the Cricket Strategy Game in this paper. The game is developed using C++ programming language and many exciting concepts such as random number generation phenomenon, file handling, and few concepts of cricket are mixed proportionately to develop this game and make it interesting for its users and players. The random numbers generated are cleverly assigned values to vary according to the inputs of the user, thus making the game a very dynamic and filled with astonishment. Through this game we successfully simulate the real life role of a cricket team captain or manager or director. The players will feel the exact feeling that the captain feels in a match scenario. The game has been designed in such a way, and the technology and concepts are used so effectively, to develop this Cricket Strategy Game in a way that the users will find it really simulating and real-life like.
