In cricket the performance of the players whether bowler or batsman is being analyzed with the help of very simple statistical tools. Mostly average scores, strike rate, average runs per wicket are being used. The main idea of this research study is to give the application of quality control charts in evaluating the performance of the players. We have made the comparative study of the two outstanding batsman of this game. We used the individual and moving range control charts for evaluating their performances. We applied basic sensitizing rules to analyze the non random and un-natural variation present in their performance. We will give the opportunity to analysts to check in the light of their knowledge for the assignable causes that have made the scores out of control so that in future these un-natural variations can be controlled and performance can be improved.
