This review discusses the hypothesis that hitting a cricket ball depends on predicting the instant that the ball will be located in the volume of space within which it can be successfully hit, and that this prediction is based on retinal image correlates of the direction of motion in depth and the time to collision (or time to passage). The performance of top cricket players allows an estimation of their accuracy in this spatio-temporal prediction. The bowler challenges the batsman's skill by (1) causing the ball to change direction in flight and/or after bouncing and (2) causing linked variations in the speed and trajectory of the ball. I suggest that the linked variations of speed and trajectory exploit a visual inadequacy of the batsman, namely poor sensitivity to the instantaneous absolute distance and speed of the ball. Two alternative hypothese are also discussed, one based on eye movements, the other based on continuous coupling between perception and action.
